### Module 4: Kubernetes Cluster using Kops

# Introduction

[Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/README.md), short for Kubernetes Operations, is a set of tools for installing, operating, and deleting Kubernetes clusters from the command line. A rolling upgrade of an older version of Kubernetes to a new version can also be performed. It also manages the cluster add-ons. It is supported on AWS and is another widely used tool to create Kubernetes cluster on AWS
