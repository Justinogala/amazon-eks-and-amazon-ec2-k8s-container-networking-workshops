# What have we accomplished

We have:

1. Configured two Cloud9 environments for EKS and `kops` in Module 0.
2. Understood container network namespace fundamentals in Module 1.
3. Installed tools to help create Kubernetes clusters in Module 2.
4. Created (based on the modules attempted) Kubernetes clusters using `kops` or Amazon EKS in Module 2.
5. Understood pod-to-pod communications within a node or across nodes of the cluster.
