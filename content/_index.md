In this advanced workshop, we dive deep into the different networking options for deploying containers at production scale on Amazon EKS and Kubernetes on Amazon EC2. We review architectural best practices, the different relevant industry standards that are leveraged within these services, and Container Networking Interface (CNI) options best suited for workload types and challenges from big data jobs to machine learning simulations. This workshop includes hands-on labs to facilitate a better understanding of the networking underpinnings of the various container deployment options. It also covers important concepts around container network namespaces, iptables, routing, and traffic management between multiple nodes.
